Hi! My name is Eunhye Choe, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College. I work with [Peter Tse](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/peter) and [Patrick Cavanagh](https://cavlab.net/). I am currently studying visual perception, with a focus on how intention and attentional deployment modulate complex signal components in the human brain.
 
I am originally from Gyeonggi, South Korea, and I earned my B.A. and M.A. in Psychology at Yonsei University, where I worked with [Min-Shik Kim](http://cognition.yonsei.ac.kr/). Before coming to the U.S., I worked as a post-master's researcher at the Korea Brain Research Institute with [Su Keun Jeong](https://sites.google.com/view/skjeong/home).
 
For more details, check out my [CV](https://eunhyechoe.github.io/cv).
 
ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· Quick Korean Tip: How to pronounce my name
=====
'Eun' sounds like the end of the word 'button' (the 'nn' sound, without the 'butt' ðŸ˜‚). For 'Hye,' just say 'hey' or 'yeah' but add a quick, soft 'h' sound at the beginning.
 
Youâ€™ve now mastered how to pronounce my name like a Korean! ðŸŽ‰
